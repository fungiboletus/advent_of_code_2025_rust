# Advent of code 2025 in Rust

Some so-so Rust code related to the [2025 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/).

Like in [2021](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2021_rust), in [2022](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2022_rust), in [2023](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2023_rust), and in [2024](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2024_rust),
I will not do all days because it stops being fun after a while.

Parsing the input data is done with [nom](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom), which is usually the most fun part of the exercise.
